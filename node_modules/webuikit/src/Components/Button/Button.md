```

`import { Button } from 'WebUIKit'`

```jsx
<Button {props}>Button</Button>
```

## Examples

### Basic button

```js
<Button>Save</Button>
```

### Button appearance

The `appearance` prop defines the overall visual style of the Button. You can use
this prop to indicate to the user the purpose or importance of the button, or call
their attention to it.


```js
<div>
  <Stack>
    <Button>cta</Button>
    <Button appearance="outline" btnCOlor="teal">teal</Button>
    <Button  btnCOlor="red">secondary</Button>
    <Button>default</Button>
    <Button appearance="outline" btnCOlor="red">destructive</Button>
    <Button appearance="link" icon="copy" label="I'm a button, but look like a link." />
  </Stack>
</div>
```

### Button sizes

You can create buttons of various sizes.

- Large buttons are used for calls to action and in empty page states.
- Default-sized buttons are used in most situations, like in Form Actions and Dialogs.
- Compressed buttons are used for filters or inline forms.
- Small buttons are used inside tables: in editable rows, or row actions.

```js
<div>
  <Stack>
    <Button size="large">large</Button>
    <Button>default</Button>
    <Button size="compressed">compressed</Button>
    <Button size="small">small</Button>
  </Stack>
</div>
```

### Button states

You can disable a button if you don't want the user to be able to click it. You can also add a spinner
to indicate that data is loading, or a success checkmark to indicate (for example) that data has been
saved successfully.

```js
<div>
  <Stack>
    <Button disabled>Disabled</Button>
    <Button loading>Loading</Button>
    <Button success>Success</Button>
  </Stack>
</div>
```

### Icon buttons

Icon buttons work well in compact spaces. You can pick name of `icon` from [docs/Icon](#/component/icon)

```js
<div>
  <Stack>
    <Button appearance="link" icon="copy" />
    <Button icon="copy" />
  </Stack>
</div>
```

### Adding tooltips

You can set the `label` property to add a tooltip that will appear when the user hovers over
the button. This can help clarify the purpose of the button, and is especially useful with
buttons that only have an icon and no text.

```js
<Button icon="copy" label="Copy to clipboard" />
```
